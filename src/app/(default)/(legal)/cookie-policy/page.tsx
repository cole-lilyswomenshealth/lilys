        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This Cookie Policy explains how Direct2Her ("we," "our," or "us") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website or use our mobile application (collectively, "Services"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please read this Cookie Policy carefully. By continuing to browse or use our Services, you agree to our use of cookies and similar technologies as described in this Cookie Policy.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Direct2Her) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Services to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Services. Third parties may use cookies through our Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Services and the purposes they perform are described below:
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Essential Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Services and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. These cookies are essential for enabling user authentication, security, network management, and accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of essential cookies we use:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Authentication cookies:</strong> These cookies help us identify you when you log in to our platform so we can provide personalized healthcare services.</li>
          <li><strong>Security cookies:</strong> These cookies help us detect and prevent security risks, such as unauthorized access attempts.</li>
          <li><strong>Functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies remember your preferences and settings to enhance your experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Services, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our Services function.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Services. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of performance and analytics cookies we use:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to understand how visitors interact with our Services.</li>
          <li><strong>Hotjar:</strong> We use Hotjar to better understand our users' needs and to optimize our service and experience.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Targeting and Advertising Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of targeting and advertising cookies we use:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Facebook Pixel:</strong> This helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns on Facebook.</li>
          <li><strong>Google Ads:</strong> These cookies are used to serve relevant ads based on your interests and past interactions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Survey and AI Recommendation Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          When you complete surveys on our platform, we may use cookies to remember your progress and responses, allowing you to continue where you left off if you don't complete the survey in one session. These cookies also help us enhance the recommendation process when we use AI technology (such as OpenAI) to generate personalized product and treatment suggestions based on your survey answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of survey and recommendation cookies we use:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Survey progress cookies:</strong> These remember your place in multi-step surveys and questionnaires.</li>
          <li><strong>Preference cookies:</strong> These remember your previous responses to help us provide more relevant information and recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. How Can You Control Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie table above.
